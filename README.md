F.A.Q:


1) How do i install the hud:

-Download the hud and unzip it

-Follow the "Installation Guide" file


.


2) My Fonts are looking weird/differen from the screenshots:

Go to resource/fonts and install the fonts (right click on the font file and select install)


.


3) I want to use a customization but i don't know how to do it:

Is really easy, after you install the hud (FAQ 1) select what customization you want to apply, let's take as example the killstreak icon.
Open the "killstreak icon enabled" folder and copy the resource folder, then go to your custom folder and paste and replace the customization files over your old hud files.
Same with the other customizations!


.


4) Where i can find and enable the hud crosshairs:

Crosshairs.res file in the scripts folder! open this file and set the visible value of the crosshair you want to 1.
